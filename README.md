### Hi everyone! 

I'm currently a Software Engineer at System1. By day, I'm working on the next generation of MapQuest.  By night, I'm writing for and helping build BetterDev, and recently launched FlashMD.  I have a passion for learning, and want to understand the wonderful language we know as JavaScript as thoroughly as possible.
