### Hi everyone! 

I'm currently a Software Engineer at System1. By day, I do a lot of stuff with React (and some Scala here and there, when forced...).  By night, I've been diving into functional programming and AWS architecture.  I have a passion for learning, and want to understand the wonderful language we know as JavaScript as thoroughly as possible.
