### Hi everyone! 

I'm currently a Software Engineer at System1. By day, I do a lot of stuff with AngularJS and Node.  By night, I've been diving into React, grinding JS fundamentals and concepts, and whatever else I can get my hands on.  I have a passion for learning, and want to understand the wonderful language we know as JavaScript as thoroughly as possible.
